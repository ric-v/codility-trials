# Binary Gap Checker

A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N. 

eg : `N = 1041 the function should return 5, because N has binary representation 10000010001 and so its longest binary gap is of length 5. `

`N = 32 the function should return 0, because N has binary representation '100000' and thus no binary gaps`
