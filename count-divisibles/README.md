# Count Divisibles

Given three integers A, B and K, returns the number of integers within the range [A..B] that are divisible by K, i.e.:

`{ i : A ≤ i ≤ B, i mod K = 0 }`

For example, for `A = 6, B = 11 and K = 2`, your function should return 3, because there are three numbers divisible by 2 within the range [6..11], namely 6, 8 and 10.
