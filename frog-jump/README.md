# Frog Jump

A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. 
The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.

Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.

For example, given:

`  X = 10
  Y = 85
  D = 30`
the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:

`after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100`
