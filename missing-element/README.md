# Missing Element

An array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.

For example, given array A such that:

`  A[0] = 2
  A[1] = 3
  A[2] = 1
  A[3] = 5`
the function should `return 4`, as it is the missing element.
