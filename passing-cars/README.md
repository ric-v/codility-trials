# Passing Cars

A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive cars on a road.

Array A contains only 0s and/or 1s:

0 represents a car traveling east,
1 represents a car traveling west.
The goal is to count passing cars. We say that a pair of cars (P, Q), where 0 â‰¤ P < Q < N, is passing when P is traveling to the east and Q is traveling to the west.

For example, consider array A such that:

  `A[0] = 0
  A[1] = 1
  A[2] = 0
  A[3] = 1
  A[4] = 1`
We have five pairs of passing cars: `(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)`.
