# Permutation Checker

A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.

A permutation is a sequence containing each element from 1 to N once, and only once.

For example, array A such that:

    `A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 2`
is a permutation, but array A such that:

    `A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3`
is not a permutation, because value 2 is missing.

The goal is to check whether array A is a permutation.
